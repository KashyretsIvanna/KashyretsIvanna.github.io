                        <p>There is a proverb: “Good clothes open all doors”. It means that when people don’t know you they judge you by appearance and especially clothes. When you see the person wearing a perfect expensive suit your brain creates the image of successful businessmen in front of you.</p>

                        <p>Instead, the person wearing old jeans and simple T-shirt won’t be allowed to enter the restaurant or many other establishments. It’s considered normal, but should it be this way?</p>

                        <p>For the vast majority of people, the word “fashion” means a lot and makes their way of living. Nowadays it’s still associated with clothes and accessories but, moreover, it influences our choice of food, technologies and even medicine.</p>

                        <p>A lot of people waste money in order to seem to be fashionable and follow modern tendencies. Furthermore, they don’t choose the things they like just to correspond with social demands. Running this rat race people forget about their personal identity, their tastes and wishes.</p>

Most clothes perfectly suit fashion shows and ideal model bodies but not the real life. Choosing extremely fashionable things you risk looking funny and dull. Anyway, the power of fashion industry is so strong that it’s difficult to struggle with the desire to be similar to people from magazine covers or billboards.</p></div>
